            "I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles, and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.\n",

We reserved for six, but it\\'s based on a first come, first served basis. Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef\\'s station. Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef\\'s station) had \"Reserved\" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef\\'s station. I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten. There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you\\'re not able to see the chef directly. Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley\\'s Restaurant in Cave Creek). The servers weren\\'t obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full. We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn\\'t great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance. For this event, we were served three courses: an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entrée (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo). Each course was paired with a different glass of wine: John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entrée), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d\\'asti (dessert). I\\'m not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over. Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved). The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good. Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion. The two-wash ranch chicken entrée was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut. This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist. Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms. The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert. With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;POther highlights:* Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)* Recipes to take home* Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)* Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom. The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so. The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom. It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d\\'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully. The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening. My friend used Sanctuary\\'s wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.',\n",

The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay. We decided it was so great we never left the resort. The Room was very clean and very comfortable. Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely. The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing. The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable. The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three. The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning. I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it. The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort. I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool. Worth every penny. Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there. Enjoy,',\n",

For these prices, it should be. Don't get me wrong, it was very good. Just not great. The lobby bar, Onyx, is small but get's hopping and is a welcome retreat from relaxation when you need some fun strangers to talk with. Having stayed here twice and visiting friends for cocktails on their patios, I can tell you the rooms varied greatly from huge to average in size. Some with lap pools and patios while others had private decks up against the hills. The wonderful smell of chiminea burning along the paths add to a delightful get-a-way.

I needed a place for seven nights (eight days) while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix. I had two basic needs, a place that was cheap and had free internet. That they had a daily breakfast was a plus, as was laundry facilities. They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel. I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave. and she said, \"OH yeah, the numbers are funny that way!\" Ha! Very funny. After that first time, I didn\\'t have any trouble finding my way back to it again. My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward. I was pretty much set.I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly). He gave me a room on the third floor that was \"overlooking the pool\" (P.S. all rooms are \"overlooking the pool\"). He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was. It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did. There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn\\'t matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!).The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings. My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower. The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron. There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate. There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio. There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs. The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so. I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn\\'t have a trouble getting out of bed either. Perfect.Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts. The menus were laminated, meaning the that choices did not change, but that was ok. I chose two eggs, sausage, hash browns, whole wheat toast, oj and coffee every morning. By the second day, I was greeted by name. That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro. I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn. Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home. Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn\\'t bother me. The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down. I didn\\'t go to any of the happy hours (friends don\\'t let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map. I made this huge circuitous route because I didn\\'t know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying. Next time I will know!!All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort. Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don\\'t need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby). Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!Yep, next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort, it\\'s got it all.',\n",

This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place. It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe. This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!), and a very courteous front desk staff.The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!! This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it.

We had a 3rd floor garden view, which was very Zen with a natural pond and fountain, and access to their Regency Club (a must have). The spa was very nice and they carry high quality products. They also have so many options to hang by a pool, including a private spa mineral pool (sans children). We understand there is a great kids pool also. The food was delicious at their restaurant also.We did not experience any construction issues (as they may be finished), but we certainly benefited from all their efforts. It is beautifully appointed and plenty of spaces that feel private. It is not a convention-like hotel, but I have heard (from a corporate event planner) they do a wonderful job for large parties. Everyone from the valet, to registration, housekeeping and wait staff were more than accommodating and very friendly. Kudos to their general manager, who when we brought up the issue of not having enough drawer space, immediately remedied the situation. (I won't say how, as I don't want to turn it into a precedent. I'll just say, he went above and beyond.)I would return to Scottsdale just to visit the Hyatt. Happens to be a bonus we have wonderful family that we can visit too!\",\n",

Unfortunately they had a freak cold spell and I was unable to use the 10 pools, jacuzzi, waterslide, or any other outdoor facilities, but I did take a short walk around. I also had a balcony looking out at the pools and the mountains, but unfortunately it was too cold to utilize that too. The restaurants were too pricxey for me so I can't speak to those. Parking is free at the hotel. I did check out the Native American Education Center and thought that was a nice thing to have. I never did make it to the spa unfortunately. Service was top notch: when I first arrived my key did not work and I stopped an engineer in the hall who got a new key sent up, and when I asked her where the ice machine was, she said I could call the bellman and he would bring some to me (I couldn't be that lazy, so I did go down the hall and get it myself). The bathroom was stocked with Portico products (decent sized bottles) and had a ginormous shower with a rainfall head and a handheld jet. I also appreciate the small light under the mirror which I could leave on at night rather than having to leave a larger light on. There was a refrigerator in the room which I used to stock water and bubbly from the Safeway down the road (the hotel is very convenient to many restaurants and shops). One of the best things was that the wake up call was a good old fashined person, not a machine, and she offered to call me back--gotta love a live snooze button! When I went to check out, the folio on the TV showed charges, so I called downstairs, explained I had prepaid the package, and the front desk people solved the issue very quickly to my satisfaction. Also, they have machines by the front desk that allow you to check in and print your boarding pass.My one complaint and why I did not give it a fifth star: charging for internet. Seriously, in this day and age, that to me felt like it was nickling and diming the guests, many who pay a lot to stay at the resort.For those who go to Scottsdale, I definitely recommend the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch (and check out the Hyatt Vacations website for some good deals).UPDATE: I checked my cc bill three days later and they had double charged me after all, despite giving me a zeroed out receipt. Poor form, Hyatt. She credited back to me, but what if I hadn't noticed?\",\n",

This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do.All in all though, probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area, especially for the price.

I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.\",\n",

The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands. The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room. Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good. Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one.\",\n",

More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I\\'m being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It\\'s just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the \"worst and trashiest\". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.Nighttime:Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it\\'s a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool. But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I\\'m a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o\\' cash.Rooms:I\\'ve been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small.',\n",

I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer. After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try. Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt. The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar. Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant. The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here. During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting. Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place.\",\n",

Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint! We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us. It couldn't have went better! Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!!\",\n",

              "   {'review': 'Known as \"The Jewel of the Desert\" and the \"Grand Dame,\" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design. The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright. Hence, the main restaurant\\'s name is \"Frank and Albert\\'s.\"Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history. Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly. A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance. For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet. The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless. I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.So, my first experience was our dinner at \"Frank and Albert\\'s\", formerly known as the \"Biltmore Grill.\" Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes. From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner\\'s Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference. The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods. The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their \"bloody rose\" cocktail. I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail. However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices. Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food. Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla. The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property. It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge. Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies. We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well. The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern. The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins. Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in. A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7. Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar. I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner. The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets. Silky soft...We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge. Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day. We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool. We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.Recommendations:go to biltmore\\'s website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.About Ocatilla:basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the loungebusiness center (computers, internet, printers)Wii rentals pressing service and shoe shinetherapeutic turn down bathneck and shoulder massages every thursdaypersonal concierge',\n",

Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage. The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio. The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days. Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there. We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens. You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever. Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google. I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research. All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay. I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!',\n",

Funky beige tiles everywhere, dark dingy shower with frosted glass window that really doesn't let much light in. I know they're trying and they're so so close to being amazing in every respect, but the rooms could be improved upon.The pool areas, common areas, poolside bar, and convention areas are gorgeous though!! You instantly feel right at home in these areas and it was beyond pleasurable just hanging out at the hotel! Really perfect for group gathering and family away-time. And did I mention everything is gorgeous?? Because it really is! Only other negative is that they charge a ridiculous amount for wifi, which is in ADDITION to the daily resort fee, and don't provide complimentary water bottles, which you would think would be a no brainer for a luxury resort in the middle of a desert state.\",\n",

We stayed in the 9000 section of the hotel which is behind the convention center part. I'd recommend this if you want something quiet where you won't get noise from the front parking area or pools. Yes, I said pools...a great thing for those of us who only wanted to relax and get some sun.Every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us. We had a two queen room and the room itself was very large and I liked that every room has either a patio or balcony. Our view happened to be of the basketball and tennis court but it was nice to be able to go outside and sit on the patio in the morning to have coffee and relax. I assume that we had a room that had already been renovated since the bedding looked new...and the bed was SO comfortable! The breakfast buffet is good and it's nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that. Other than that we mostly just had drinks while laying by the pool. The only negative thing that comes to mind is the fact that the toilets are VERY loud when flushed. I have no idea if it was the rooms next to us or above us but every time someone flushed a toilet in the middle of the night I woke up....I am a light sleeper but still, if there are more renovations to be done I hope this is something they can address.The location is great and I can't wait to book my next trip back.\",\n",

We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the \"Madonna Special\" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty\\'s Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course. Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!',\n",

After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude. The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers. We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly. The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic. For $13 the salad was a total miss. Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate. I was hungry though, so it worked.The next morning we slept in as late as we could. I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!) so I called the front desk for some Tums. No problem, they arrived pronto. We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after. I would love to come back here and stay a little longer. The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.\",\n",

We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs. For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom. My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small. The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor. The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom. If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list. Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall. A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf. My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique.\",\n",

The breakfast buffet also tasted good. The hotel rooms are nice, although they only have $5 water available which is annoying and the fridge is LOCKED so you can't store any of your drinks.The reason why I docked 2 stars was not so much the tweakers, as it was the LOUD clunk sound whenever the AC turns off.

The bathroom was nice as well. The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.The pool area is where it's at though. They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better. Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend. It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on.\",\n",

San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out. I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!When I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more. (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).I will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast! I took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile. Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.So, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!\",\n",

While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70\\'s. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. Normally I\\'m pretty lenient about things like that but, c\\'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you\\'re trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It\\'s a little tough under the current conditions.Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It\\'s located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There\\'s a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt\\'s business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a \"restaurant\" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin\\'s around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there\\'s a Chipotle around the corner. I didn\\'t see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I\\'m used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it\\'s all cloth anyway.If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I\\'m on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I\\'d easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There\\'s plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder. The interior of this Courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation',\n",

There was a little seating area by the kitchen as well.The bedrooms were both a good size and the master bedroom had a huuuuuge bathroom. It also had his and her's sink and tons of space. I was sad that I didn't get to use the shower because it was a walk-in shower and was spacious.There was also a larger sitting area with a tv and fireplace and it also had a pull out bed from the couch. I recommend getting a villa if you will be sharing the space with a few people as there is tons of room!To get to the block party we were going to, we called taxis and the Hilton also sent over shuttles to get us to and from. They weren't charging but did ask for tips. They were really easy to communicate with since we had so many people and they did an awesome job!My only complaint is that some of the outlets in the bathroom and the room didn't work. It wasn't too big of a deal since I found one that worked that was luckily by a mirror so I could do my hair, haha. Other than that, our short stay at the Hilton was great and I wish we could have gotten more use out of the villa.\",\n",

(why don't more hotels do this?) the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either.

The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. Bad:1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.Ugly:1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn\\'t cost a thing so I guess that\\'s not really \"ugly\".Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit.',\n",

I was over the moon after this stay.I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds. Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!\",\n",

It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles, and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.\",\n",

I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that\\'s just my personal preference, but it wasn\\'t like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it\\'s just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.I have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we\\'re both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we\\'ve ever slept on. Couldn\\'t exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. If you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn\\'t pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you\\'re right near the highway and there\\'s quite a bit of stuff within walking distance. We got some DELICIOUS takeout from some of the local restaurants, and it was SUPER Handy to have a microwave and kitchenette available within the room for our use!So yeah, I gotta say, I didn\\'t mind this place one tiny little bit.

What first attracted us was the rate, but what made us happy with the choice was the cleanliness, coolness (literally--good air conditioning), and accessibility of the hotel. It\\'s wheelchair accessible. The best part of the hotel is the staff. The front desk team was incredibly helpful--much more so than you typically see at a chain hotel--and they gave us regular maps/handouts as well as printouts that were tailored individually for our needs. Even more astounding, though, was the cleanliness of the room: the staff cleaned the room so well after our first night that when we returned on day two, it looked like we had just walked into the room for the first time. (In my experience, most hotels do a better clean-up job in between guest stays rather than do a good job every single day, but these folks are the exception.)Reasonable, hot breakfast. Eggs, swine, cereals, pastries, juice, milk, coffee, fruit, yogurt... You\\'ve had it a million times, but they do it just fine.The definition of 4 stars is \"Yay! I\\'m a fan.\" And that\\'s true. Didn\\'t give it 5 stars because it\\'s not \"Woohoo!

I usually stay in Scottsdale when i am here for spring training, but I was here for a conference and walked to the convention center each day with no problems. It made sense to be downtown instead of Scottsdale. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice and big and the free breakfast is decent. I did not visit the pool, so I cannot comment on it. Someone mentioned the area being shady, i walked to and from here at least twice a day including late night and never felt it was a bad area. Also, the review about passing cars was not an issue for me. I was on the street side and I'm a light sleeper. Maybe their window was open? i do agree that you can hear your neighbors in the bathroom, slightly annoying. In, summary - this hotel is a great choice and if the need arises, I'd stay again.\",\n",

At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back (a 5 minute walk) to our hotel safely! We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having \"bed bugs\" and being dirty. You won\\'t have that problem staying here! The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating! That was probably the best part: Friendly staff! The staff literally gave off a small town feel, the only time I\\'ve ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast! And the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it. After drinking all night and being hung over, all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs, sausage, ham, toast, bagels, waffles, apple and orange juice and we were re-fueled up for some more debauchery!

The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on. The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small. My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries. I'm still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word. Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs. Their sound insulation is terrible. There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too. They've done a nice job of spiffying it up, but I did not find it to be appropriate for a business traveler.\",\n",

Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home. No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay. Score. We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities. It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite). Life was grand.Until the morning. *bang bang* WTF is that noise? *bang bang* There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn\\'t happening on the bed. Are they really doing construction at 8:15am? It continued. My girlfriend called down to the front desk. The noise stopped. Then it continued. *bang bang* We were about to lose it. They called our room, \"do you mind if they continue working?\". Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests. No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal. A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn\\'t even necessary. Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable. They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room. Nice place, the presidential villa. It\\'s actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet, you know...typical amenities. I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks. Naturally, if they hadn\\'t done enough, they comped dinner as well.We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that. But they more than made up for it. They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately. I can\\'t ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service. I would not hesitate to stay here again.',\n",

Nice.Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great. I'll still probably stay a Marriott user when I return, but I'll sure consider the Garden Inn again.\",\n",

The setting is lovely, rooms are sumptuous (one year we did get one that was pretty rickety and needed a do-over,however), staff is very friendly and generally accomodating. BUT, we usually arrive about noon and I end up sitting in the lobby until the room is available. This time it was available at 3:35 PM. I'm glad we called the day before and asked for it to be expedited since we're Starwood members and have stayed there several times before and would be arriving early. I know they have a noon checkout, but, cmon, three and a half hours to clean a room?! They guarantee the room will be ready at 4 so I guess I should count my blessings that I got in 25 min. early. Food in the restaurants is always good, as it should be, again, for the prices they charge. I cringe at a fruit cup with yogurt for $9.00. The Center for Well-Being, their spa/exercise area is very nice. Friends and I took advantage of some of the classes such as water exercise in the pool, belly dancing, pilates, etc. Instructors all knew their stuff and were fun and friendly. I am always amused by the fact that you can stay at a cheap motel off any superhighway and get free wifi, coffee in the room and often free breakfast. At The Phoenician there's no coffee pot in the room ($4. a cup downstairs), extra charge for internet access, etc. It's a lovely place but could, and should, be so much more.\",\n",

I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was \"Are you a guest here?\" Followed by \"because we get a lot of people around here...\" While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk. This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no. I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look. I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool? Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land. Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital. So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers. Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool. Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk. There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc. I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no. It had been misplaced. Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener. Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me. I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against. It\\'s a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card. The rooms are large here. The elevator takes forever!

But then a really nice man hooked me up with a voucher for this hotel accomodation!I didn\\'t realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Manager\\'s happy hour in the evenings; this one was 5:30 - 7:30...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful.A nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some \"things to do ideas\" around the area - movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door, 7-11 and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa. She even told me how to access the internet free of charge. I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk. It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold. I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didn\\'t find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy. I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than 10 minutes!I thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didn\\'t realize how tired I was! The bed was great! Comfy and warm! I didn\\'t want to get up! But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items.Next morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt. I wouldn\\'t mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover!#Yelp 365 Challenge - 124/365',\n",

Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.\",\n",

This place was surprisingly awesome, considering it's right next to Old Town. Walking up to the rooms part from the outside/back is not very impressive, they kind of look kind of like converted apartments. But inside is contemporary looking, little older, but still nice. The landscaping is awesome. Beds are really comfy, the kind you sink into. Which is a huge plus for me, since i'm expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment. No dated tube TV's, yay! We had an LG LCD, and the channel selection was decent, they were all in analog though.I was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious Old Town, but it was really quiet. The only noise we had was a neighbor's dog deciding to bark at like midnight... (They are pet friendly and provide beds, bowls and walks for dogs)All the rooms have patios so, if it's not bloody hot it's nice to sit outside in the morning, listen to the birds, and people watch. Our room came with a bucket'o'beer deal as well that we didn't use, esp since I can't drink. It was all crappy domestics of the bartender's choice. The only complaint I have about it was that the pool was packed most of the day.. We went back to the pool around 10:30pm to relax and there was still 5-6 children playing in the pool and the spa. What little kids are doing awake and at the pool at like 11pm, I don't know. Those are some responsible parents... But for $92 a night and all the stuff they include with it, it's definitely worth it.\",\n",

I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort. Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid. However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here. At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads. I want them. It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance. Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort. However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil. (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked. It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small. The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about. It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us. However, I will say the bed sucked. When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him. They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow. I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings. Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!! Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails. Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer? The pool area. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good. There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand. However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests. And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool. Suggestion to hotel: Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile? It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all. And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall. Almost too much shade. It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade. It made me majorly pissy. Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action. If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few miles from of the place. (so you can drink and have a driver)\",\n",

Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one. The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone. The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour. The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen. I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun. Cheers.\",\n",

I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.

Awesome and I mean it.My hubby is out on his meetings and I'm juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ). Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil' girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy.Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks was actully tasty.I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, I'll head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun.Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything.

We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It\\'s not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it\\'s pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the \"town\" and taking goofy pictures of each other.Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita\\'s Kitchen and both were fantastic. We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!',\n",

This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car. The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby. They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car. The food in Deseo is amazing. I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails. I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine). They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat. When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas. This was a very thoughtful touch.If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food. I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops. Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive. Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view. Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.

Location was good for what I was there for (work)2. The nightly rates were really cheap (this had to do with my company more than the establishment though)3. Easy enough drive to/from the airport4. You can almost bypass Phoenix altogether getting to Scottsdale.5. Their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road (think Best Buy, Target, McDonalds, etc...)6. A pretty happening restaurant/bar up the street that gets two thumbs-up7. The rooms were actually really spacious and nice...it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size (full kitchen, massive bathroom, den seating area & king size bed in a comfortably sized room).8. Hot tub was rockin\\' & nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there.CONS:1. Once I checked in, I had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and I couldn\\'t see my rental car (maybe I\\'m weird...but I like to have my car close by)2. I unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn\\'t working (Must have!), called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room (mind you I just unpacked...AGH!)3. I ate dinner a couple times with co-workers in their lounge, & while it was good...it wasn\\'t great, so we all ate at the restaurant/bar up the street the rest of the time.4. Be aware, you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around...so you have been warned, but otherwise it\\'s real clean.I\\'d stay here again pending that I got the same room rates that I did last time, but it\\'s my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates.***Don\\'t get sucked into any of that \"time-share\" crap...they don\\'t push it like some other places I\\'ve been...but it\\'s NEVER a good investment***',\n",

The price was great--as was its proximity to places of interest--and this is why we stayed here. But the free internet and breakfast was not worth the inexpensive price. I would definitely pay more to stay at a nicer place that feels a lot safer. The hotel is neighboring a strip club and the acoustics are terrible. We experienced this fully when our neighbors next door got into a huge verbal altercation at 5:00 AM, where the police were called :( not fun. The staff are friendly, but the hotel feels like it is under new management or still opening as everything is very unorganized and unfinished. The lady would not give me a printed receipt for our stay. Another example: they have microwaves in the rooms, but not microwaves safe plates to use. A little strange? There is a Residence Inn down the street with similar amenities that I would be willing to try if I am in the area again.\",\n",

It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.',\n",

Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant. The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm. We reserved for six, but it\\'s based on a first come, first served basis. Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef\\'s station. Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef\\'s station) had \"Reserved\" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef\\'s station. I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten. There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you\\'re not able to see the chef directly. Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley\\'s Restaurant in Cave Creek). The servers weren\\'t obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full. We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn\\'t great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance. For this event, we were served three courses: an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entrée (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo). Each course was paired with a different glass of wine: John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entrée), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d\\'asti (dessert). I\\'m not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over. Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved). The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good. Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion. The two-wash ranch chicken entrée was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut. This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist. Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms. The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert. With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;POther highlights:* Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)* Recipes to take home* Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)* Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom. The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so. The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom. It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d\\'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully. The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening. My friend used Sanctuary\\'s wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.'}],\n",

              "    'review': 'I\\'ve not stayed at this resort, but have been here twice; once for a wedding and the other for a Lunch & Learn event. Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant. The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm. We reserved for six, but it\\'s based on a first come, first served basis. Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef\\'s station. Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef\\'s station) had \"Reserved\" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef\\'s station. I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten. There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you\\'re not able to see the chef directly. Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley\\'s Restaurant in Cave Creek). The servers weren\\'t obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full. We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn\\'t great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance. For this event, we were served three courses: an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entrée (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo). Each course was paired with a different glass of wine: John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entrée), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d\\'asti (dessert). I\\'m not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over. Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved). The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good. Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion. The two-wash ranch chicken entrée was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut. This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist. Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms. The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert. With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;POther highlights:* Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)* Recipes to take home* Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)* Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom. The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so. The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom. It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d\\'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully. The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening. My friend used Sanctuary\\'s wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.'}],\n",

This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot. Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which I've heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there.I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc. We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us. Now thats service. Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets. Loveitloveit.At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort. It deserves its own review so I'll write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing. A great date spot for even those who aren't spending the night at the hotel.\"},\n",

He was out in the sun in upper 90/lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests. I ate at Elements the other times I visited Arizona, but the poolside menu is great too! I preferred the orange chicken bento box. Although edamame was not on the poolside menu, our waiter was able to get it for us. That is great service!The bed was very comfortable; nice and soft. I also liked the wall-mounted, flatscreen LCD tv.The valet service was great as well. We were greeted everytime we drove into the Sanctuary complex. The tennis courts were very nice as well. I played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up.'},\n",

Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!\"},\n",

They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel.

After that first time, I didn\\'t have any trouble finding my way back to it again. My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward. I was pretty much set.I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly). He gave me a room on the third floor that was \"overlooking the pool\" (P.S. all rooms are \"overlooking the pool\"). He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was. It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did. There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn\\'t matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!).The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings. My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower. The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron. There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate. There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio. There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs. The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so. I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn\\'t have a trouble getting out of bed either. Perfect.Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts.

That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro. I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn. Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home. Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn\\'t bother me. The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down. I didn\\'t go to any of the happy hours (friends don\\'t let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map. I made this huge circuitous route because I didn\\'t know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying. Next time I will know!!All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort. Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don\\'t need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby). Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!Yep, next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort, it\\'s got it all.'},\n",

              "    'review': \"This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn. This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place. It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe. This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!), and a very courteous front desk staff.The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!! This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it. But it is an incredible bargain, comfortable, and very quiet.\"},\n",

The Sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport. I stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at 3:30am (Complimentary). Ugh so early, but my driver was very friendly. The night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check-out till 1:30. SO AWESOME! I love late check outs, they make your day/morning better. No need to rush. The bathroom is a little small, vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa.My little sister and Mom enjoyed the pool as well. Nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too. If I ever have to fly out of Phoenix or into Phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the Sheraton Phoenix Airport.'}],\n",

Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice. Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel. The only cons I can think of were...the elevators were kinda slow....the toilet didn't flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds....and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahahaOver all this hotel is a very nice one to stay at and I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in Phoenix again.\"}],\n",

I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.\"},\n",

The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands. The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room. Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good. Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one.\"}],\n",

Daytime:The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I\\'d say. That\\'s no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I\\'m being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It\\'s just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the \"worst and trashiest\". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.Nighttime:Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it\\'s a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.

I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer. After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try. Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt. The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar. Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant. The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here. During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting. Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place.\"},\n",

              "    'review': \"I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time! Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint! We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us. It couldn't have went better! Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!!\"}],\n",

The king size bed was comfy with fluffy pillows. The living room had plenty of seats that faced the flat screen TV. The room has a mini-fridge and a microwave.The only gripe about this place is a very small closet and bathroom. There is barely enough room to close the door for the bathroom. The closet also had one sliding door. The continental breakfast was average. No hot food. Guests can choose either cold cereal, instant oatmeal, juice and milk, fruit, yogurt, toasts or bagels. The seating area in the kitchen was convenient for guests to enjoy their meal.If you need access to computers, they are located next to the kitchen. There is a printer as well.'}],\n",

              "    'review': 'Known as \"The Jewel of the Desert\" and the \"Grand Dame,\" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design. The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright. Hence, the main restaurant\\'s name is \"Frank and Albert\\'s.\"Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history. Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly. A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance. For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet. The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless. I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.So, my first experience was our dinner at \"Frank and Albert\\'s\", formerly known as the \"Biltmore Grill.\" Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes. From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner\\'s Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference. The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods. The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their \"bloody rose\" cocktail. I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail. However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices. Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food. Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla. The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property. It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge. Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies. We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well. The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern. The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins. Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in. A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7. Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar. I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner. The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets. Silky soft...We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge. Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day. We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool. We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.Recommendations:go to biltmore\\'s website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.About Ocatilla:basically an upgrade with your stay.

              "    'review': 'Known as \"The Jewel of the Desert\" and the \"Grand Dame,\" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design. The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright. Hence, the main restaurant\\'s name is \"Frank and Albert\\'s.\"Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history. Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly. A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance. For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet. The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless. I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.So, my first experience was our dinner at \"Frank and Albert\\'s\", formerly known as the \"Biltmore Grill.\" Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes. From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner\\'s Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference. The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods. The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their \"bloody rose\" cocktail. I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail. However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices. Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food. Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla. The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property. It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge. Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies. We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well. The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern. The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins. Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in. A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7. Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar. I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner. The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets. Silky soft...We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge. Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day. We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool. We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.Recommendations:go to biltmore\\'s website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.About Ocatilla:basically an upgrade with your stay.

Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage. The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio. The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days. Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there. We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens. You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever. Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google. I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.

The grounds are lush and well manicured and the staff was polite, friendly, and very helpful. The rooms were pretty adorable in terms of the architecture and surrounding areas. They are spacious and comfortable, but the bathrooms are VERY dated. As in, 1970's fantastic here! Funky beige tiles everywhere, dark dingy shower with frosted glass window that really doesn't let much light in. I know they're trying and they're so so close to being amazing in every respect, but the rooms could be improved upon.The pool areas, common areas, poolside bar, and convention areas are gorgeous though!! You instantly feel right at home in these areas and it was beyond pleasurable just hanging out at the hotel! Really perfect for group gathering and family away-time. And did I mention everything is gorgeous?? Because it really is! Only other negative is that they charge a ridiculous amount for wifi, which is in ADDITION to the daily resort fee, and don't provide complimentary water bottles, which you would think would be a no brainer for a luxury resort in the middle of a desert state.\"}],\n",

There was Wi-Fi, but it wasn't the best.The outside was beautiful, being surrounded by green always makes the desert better.I didn't get the chance to use the swimming pool.

We stayed in the 9000 section of the hotel which is behind the convention center part. I'd recommend this if you want something quiet where you won't get noise from the front parking area or pools. Yes, I said pools...a great thing for those of us who only wanted to relax and get some sun.Every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us. We had a two queen room and the room itself was very large and I liked that every room has either a patio or balcony. Our view happened to be of the basketball and tennis court but it was nice to be able to go outside and sit on the patio in the morning to have coffee and relax. I assume that we had a room that had already been renovated since the bedding looked new...and the bed was SO comfortable! The breakfast buffet is good and it's nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that. Other than that we mostly just had drinks while laying by the pool. The only negative thing that comes to mind is the fact that the toilets are VERY loud when flushed. I have no idea if it was the rooms next to us or above us but every time someone flushed a toilet in the middle of the night I woke up....I am a light sleeper but still, if there are more renovations to be done I hope this is something they can address.The location is great and I can't wait to book my next trip back.\"},\n",

The rooms could be nicer, our bathtub had slow drain so I was standing in dirty water while taking a shower.This last stay I did order room service and they said it would take 45 mins, but it took more then an hour for it to get to me and all I ordered was a salad. They were doing some kind of construction with some of the rooms, so it was noisy during the mid day.\"}],\n",

JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that I've gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need.The rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy. The bathroom was nice as well. The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.The pool area is where it's at though. They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better. Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend. It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on.\"},\n",

San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out. I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!When I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more. (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).I will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast! I took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile. Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.So, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!\"}],\n",

              "    'review': 'As I write this, I\\'m waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop refilling, and the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled, out of key singing.That puts me in a weird head space, review wise. While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70\\'s. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. Normally I\\'m pretty lenient about things like that but, c\\'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you\\'re trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It\\'s a little tough under the current conditions.Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It\\'s located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There\\'s a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt\\'s business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a \"restaurant\" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin\\'s around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there\\'s a Chipotle around the corner. I didn\\'t see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I\\'m used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it\\'s all cloth anyway.If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I\\'m on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I\\'d easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There\\'s plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder. The interior of this Courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation'}],\n",

(why don't more hotels do this?) the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either.

For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds. Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape.

We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.Good:1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen.2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. Bad:1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.Ugly:1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn\\'t cost a thing so I guess that\\'s not really \"ugly\".Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit.'},\n",

              "    'review': \"What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds. Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!\"},\n",

Stylings from the lobby to the furniture in your room is really well done, the hotel has a great boutique-y vibe but without the pretentiousness. The location is good, only minutes from downtown Scottsdale. One snafu while I was there... I sent out some dry cleaning that was supposed to be back by 5:30pm, didn't happen.

I\\'ve stayed at places like this before across the country, and I can definitely say that this was a very pleasant experience. Everyone has complained about the beds being hard, but I didn\\'t really find this to be the case. I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that\\'s just my personal preference, but it wasn\\'t like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it\\'s just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.I have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we\\'re both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we\\'ve ever slept on. Couldn\\'t exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. If you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn\\'t pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you\\'re right near the highway and there\\'s quite a bit of stuff within walking distance. We got some DELICIOUS takeout from some of the local restaurants, and it was SUPER Handy to have a microwave and kitchenette available within the room for our use!So yeah, I gotta say, I didn\\'t mind this place one tiny little bit. If you\\'re used to Marriotts, Hyatts, and other fancy hotels, then you need to know that this isn\\'t one of them.

The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing! The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here. Wifi was fast and easily available. Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one.

What first attracted us was the rate, but what made us happy with the choice was the cleanliness, coolness (literally--good air conditioning), and accessibility of the hotel. It\\'s wheelchair accessible. The best part of the hotel is the staff. The front desk team was incredibly helpful--much more so than you typically see at a chain hotel--and they gave us regular maps/handouts as well as printouts that were tailored individually for our needs. Even more astounding, though, was the cleanliness of the room: the staff cleaned the room so well after our first night that when we returned on day two, it looked like we had just walked into the room for the first time. (In my experience, most hotels do a better clean-up job in between guest stays rather than do a good job every single day, but these folks are the exception.)Reasonable, hot breakfast. Eggs, swine, cereals, pastries, juice, milk, coffee, fruit, yogurt... You\\'ve had it a million times, but they do it just fine.The definition of 4 stars is \"Yay! I\\'m a fan.\" And that\\'s true. Didn\\'t give it 5 stars because it\\'s not \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" to me--mostly a product of the location and lack of distinctiveness as a hotel experience--I would only give 5 stars to an excellent \"destination hotel,\" and that\\'s not this place.'}],\n",

Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.Cons:1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles6) 80s style tube TV 7) pink 80s decor8) worn down bed with body dent in it9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning. pros: 1) location2) staff smiles and says hi3) cleaning staff does a good job'}],\n",

So we had to put down about 5 towels on the floor that were drenched with water when we showered.

The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on. The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small. My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries. I'm still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word. Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs. Their sound insulation is terrible. There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too. They've done a nice job of spiffying it up, but I did not find it to be appropriate for a business traveler.\"}],\n",

We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.

I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great. I'll still probably stay a Marriott user when I return, but I'll sure consider the Garden Inn again.\"},\n",

Two story motel with gated outer access stairway, balconies to second story rooms, two inner stairwells (carpeted). No elevator, which is a shame as we had rather a lot of bags to bring inside. Still, a very clean, comfortable room.Ladies, you will appreciate the bathrooms. While the towels are not spa-quality, the room had a pleasant palette (yellow, white, chrome and beige) and one of the best showerheads I've had the pleasure to use in a motel. High enough to adjust and not hit my head (I'm just shy of six feet). Excellent water pressure. Our balcony overlooked the alleyway and nearby buildings but the rate, the sleeping accomodations and the overall comfortable feeling surpassed any minor discomforts. I'd stay here again.\"}],\n",

However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff. I was mistreated. I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was \"Are you a guest here?\" Followed by \"because we get a lot of people around here...\" While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk. This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no. I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look. I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool? Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land. Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital. So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers. Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool. Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk. There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc. I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no. It had been misplaced. Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener. Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me. I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against. It\\'s a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card. The rooms are large here. The elevator takes forever! I suggest that the hotel adopt elevator music to distract the sluggish speed of that elevator.'}],\n",

Different Pointe of View is supposed to be an awesome restaurant at the top of the resort with amazing views, but we usually opt for local, regional restaurants... Via Delosantos, Aunt Chiladas, Mi Patio are some of our favorites.Only reason for 4 stars this time is that I used Hilton Honors points for our room and I am a Diamond member.... not impressed with our location at all. We love being up high in the cliffs where you have a view, and this time we overlooked the top of a building. I was bummed... especially since we are return guests.

Next time I will request a better view.Have to say, however, that upon arrival, we were assigned a room with a group standing right outside on their balcony.... loud, smoking and arguing.

I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa. She even told me how to access the internet free of charge. I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk. It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold. I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didn\\'t find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy.

Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.\"},\n",

This place was surprisingly awesome, considering it's right next to Old Town. Walking up to the rooms part from the outside/back is not very impressive, they kind of look kind of like converted apartments. But inside is contemporary looking, little older, but still nice. The landscaping is awesome. Beds are really comfy, the kind you sink into. Which is a huge plus for me, since i'm expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment. No dated tube TV's, yay! We had an LG LCD, and the channel selection was decent, they were all in analog though.I was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious Old Town, but it was really quiet. The only noise we had was a neighbor's dog deciding to bark at like midnight... (They are pet friendly and provide beds, bowls and walks for dogs)All the rooms have patios so, if it's not bloody hot it's nice to sit outside in the morning, listen to the birds, and people watch. Our room came with a bucket'o'beer deal as well that we didn't use, esp since I can't drink. It was all crappy domestics of the bartender's choice. The only complaint I have about it was that the pool was packed most of the day.. We went back to the pool around 10:30pm to relax and there was still 5-6 children playing in the pool and the spa. What little kids are doing awake and at the pool at like 11pm, I don't know. Those are some responsible parents...

I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort. Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid. However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here. At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads. I want them. It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance. Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort. However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil. (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked. It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small. The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about. It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us. However, I will say the bed sucked. When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him. They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow. I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings. Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!! Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails. Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer? The pool area. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good. There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand. However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests. And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool. Suggestion to hotel: Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile? It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all. And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall. Almost too much shade. It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade. It made me majorly pissy. Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action. If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few miles from of the place. (so you can drink and have a driver)\"},\n",

I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort. Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid. However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here. At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads. I want them. It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance. Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort. However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil. (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked. It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small. The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about. It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us. However, I will say the bed sucked. When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him. They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow. I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings. Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!! Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails. Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer? The pool area. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good. There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand. However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests. And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool. Suggestion to hotel: Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile? It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all. And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall. Almost too much shade. It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade. It made me majorly pissy. Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action. If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few miles from of the place. (so you can drink and have a driver)\"},\n",

This place was surprisingly awesome, considering it's right next to Old Town. Walking up to the rooms part from the outside/back is not very impressive, they kind of look kind of like converted apartments. But inside is contemporary looking, little older, but still nice. The landscaping is awesome. Beds are really comfy, the kind you sink into. Which is a huge plus for me, since i'm expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment. No dated tube TV's, yay! We had an LG LCD, and the channel selection was decent, they were all in analog though.I was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious Old Town, but it was really quiet. The only noise we had was a neighbor's dog deciding to bark at like midnight... (They are pet friendly and provide beds, bowls and walks for dogs)All the rooms have patios so, if it's not bloody hot it's nice to sit outside in the morning, listen to the birds, and people watch. Our room came with a bucket'o'beer deal as well that we didn't use, esp since I can't drink. It was all crappy domestics of the bartender's choice. The only complaint I have about it was that the pool was packed most of the day.. We went back to the pool around 10:30pm to relax and there was still 5-6 children playing in the pool and the spa. What little kids are doing awake and at the pool at like 11pm, I don't know. Those are some responsible parents...

I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort. Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid. However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here. At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads. I want them. It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance. Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort. However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil. (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked. It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small. The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about. It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us. However, I will say the bed sucked. When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him. They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow. I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings. Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!! Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails. Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer? The pool area. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good. There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand. However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests. And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool. Suggestion to hotel: Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile? It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all. And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall. Almost too much shade. It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade. It made me majorly pissy. Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action. If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few miles from of the place. (so you can drink and have a driver)\"},\n",

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill.

However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here. At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads. I want them. It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance. Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort. However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil. (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked. It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small. The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about. It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us. However, I will say the bed sucked. When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him. They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow. I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings. Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!! Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails. Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer? The pool area. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good. There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand. However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests. And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool. Suggestion to hotel: Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile? It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all. And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall. Almost too much shade. It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade. It made me majorly pissy. Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.

Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.\"},\n",

This place was surprisingly awesome, considering it's right next to Old Town. Walking up to the rooms part from the outside/back is not very impressive, they kind of look kind of like converted apartments. But inside is contemporary looking, little older, but still nice. The landscaping is awesome. Beds are really comfy, the kind you sink into. Which is a huge plus for me, since i'm expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment. No dated tube TV's, yay! We had an LG LCD, and the channel selection was decent, they were all in analog though.I was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious Old Town, but it was really quiet. The only noise we had was a neighbor's dog deciding to bark at like midnight... (They are pet friendly and provide beds, bowls and walks for dogs)All the rooms have patios so, if it's not bloody hot it's nice to sit outside in the morning, listen to the birds, and people watch. Our room came with a bucket'o'beer deal as well that we didn't use, esp since I can't drink. It was all crappy domestics of the bartender's choice. The only complaint I have about it was that the pool was packed most of the day.. We went back to the pool around 10:30pm to relax and there was still 5-6 children playing in the pool and the spa. What little kids are doing awake and at the pool at like 11pm, I don't know. Those are some responsible parents... But for $92 a night and all the stuff they include with it, it's definitely worth it.\"},\n",

I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort. Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid. However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here. At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads. I want them. It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance. Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort. However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil. (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked. It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small. The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about. It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us. However, I will say the bed sucked. When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him. They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow. I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings. Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!! Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails. Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer? The pool area. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good. There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand. However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests. And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool. Suggestion to hotel: Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile? It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all. And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall. Almost too much shade. It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade. It made me majorly pissy. Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action. If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few miles from of the place. (so you can drink and have a driver)\"},\n",

The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that I'm use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (i'm an electronics junkie) just aren't there. The room really feels like any other average hotel. The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasn't one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had it's own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didn't add a bath to my massage. All in all I would stay here again since it's in a great location. Plus, the guys at the bell desk will give you a ride (within 3 miles) in a Cadillac Escalade free of charge. That was a great when it came time to partying at night!\"},\n",

The staff is showing off its Kimpton training, and the service standards were very welcome. This hotel gets high marks on all fronts.Taggia, the hotel's new restaurant, is a stylish Italian venue with a unique Ligurian-anchored menu that features fresh seafood and creative traditionally inspired dishes. A large kiva-style fireplace warms the alfresco section, and waterfalls surround it.The only downside is that Kimpton hasn't fully finished up on the room makeovers yet. Compared with Kimpton's usual attention to room furnishings and design, these digs are mild-mannered. The older patterned carpeting was disappointing.Still Kimpton has done an admirable and feverish job at making over this property. Kudos.\"},\n",

It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried. I was COMPLETELY wrong. This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car. The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby. They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car. The food in Deseo is amazing. I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails. I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine). They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat. When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas. This was a very thoughtful touch.If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food. I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops. Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive. Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view. Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite. When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort.\"},\n",

We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.[For further information, please visit: http://phoenix.gov/BNDMAPS/index.html]\"},\n",

Location was good for what I was there for (work)2. The nightly rates were really cheap (this had to do with my company more than the establishment though)3. Easy enough drive to/from the airport4. You can almost bypass Phoenix altogether getting to Scottsdale.5. Their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road (think Best Buy, Target, McDonalds, etc...)6. A pretty happening restaurant/bar up the street that gets two thumbs-up7. The rooms were actually really spacious and nice...it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size (full kitchen, massive bathroom, den seating area & king size bed in a comfortably sized room).8. Hot tub was rockin\\' & nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there.CONS:1. Once I checked in, I had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and I couldn\\'t see my rental car (maybe I\\'m weird...but I like to have my car close by)2. I unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn\\'t working (Must have!), called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room (mind you I just unpacked...AGH!)3. I ate dinner a couple times with co-workers in their lounge, & while it was good...it wasn\\'t great, so we all ate at the restaurant/bar up the street the rest of the time.4. Be aware, you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around...so you have been warned, but otherwise it\\'s real clean.I\\'d stay here again pending that I got the same room rates that I did last time, but it\\'s my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates.***Don\\'t get sucked into any of that \"time-share\" crap...they don\\'t push it like some other places I\\'ve been...but it\\'s NEVER a good investment***'}],\n",

It's something like Hotel Tempe/ Airport Inn-- InnSuites... with the word Boutique thrown in there somewhere. But, the hotel is NOT boutique... at all. The price was great--as was its proximity to places of interest--and this is why we stayed here. But the free internet and breakfast was not worth the inexpensive price. I would definitely pay more to stay at a nicer place that feels a lot safer. The hotel is neighboring a strip club and the acoustics are terrible. We experienced this fully when our neighbors next door got into a huge verbal altercation at 5:00 AM, where the police were called :( not fun. The staff are friendly, but the hotel feels like it is under new management or still opening as everything is very unorganized and unfinished. The lady would not give me a printed receipt for our stay. Another example: they have microwaves in the rooms, but not microwaves safe plates to use. A little strange? There is a Residence Inn down the street with similar amenities that I would be willing to try if I am in the area again.\"}],\n",

              "    'review': 'Sheraton Desert Oasis is a great value in the late spring/early summer to get away for a few days and relax. It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.'}],\n",
